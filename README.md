# Exercise at veeva
In this exercise I was asked to create an eks cluser and deploy on it 2 helm charts.

# About the project
These terraform files worked on my endpoint because I provided username and password for my dockerhub repo. I kept the credentials on a local file (terraform.tfvars) and did not upload it. 

Because of that it might not work properly in your environment.
I can provide you the username and password, please contact me and Ill give it to you.


This exercise was challenging and fun.
Thank you
